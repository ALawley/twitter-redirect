#### Q1/25/17

#### By Anna Lawley

## Description

This app is a small firefox add-on meant to automatically redirect from http://twitter.com to a smaller, curated list. Because the list url is pre-set to a private list, the app is intended for personal use only and will redirect to an inaccessible page if not signed in to my personal twitter account.

## Installing & Running

_This app is intended for personal use only. App will not function properly for any twitter account but my own._

## Technologies Used

Javascript, AMO
